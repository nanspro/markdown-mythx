# Latest Report
#### Source Type of data being analyzed: _solidity-file_
#### Source format of data being analyzed: _text_

## Issues
### _Unprotected SELFDESTRUCT Instruction_
The contract can be killed by anyone.

Arbitrary senders can kill this contract and withdraw its balance to their own account.

**Issue ID under Smart Contract Weakness Classification and Test Cases: SWC-106**

**High Severity**

#### Locations
The compiler generates a mapping from the bytecode to the range in the source code that generated the instruction known as source mapping.

For this particular issue the source mapping is <br/>
_112:24:0_

Where 112 is the byte-offset to the start of the range in the source file, 24 is the length of the source range in bytes and 0 is the index in sourceList.

### _Floating Pragma_
A floating pragma is set.

It is recommended to make a conscious choice on what version of Solidity is used for compilation. Currently any version equal or greater than 0.5.3 is allowed.

**Issue ID under Smart Contract Weakness Classification and Test Cases: SWC-103**

**Medium Severity**

#### Locations
The compiler generates a mapping from the bytecode to the range in the source code that generated the instruction known as source mapping.

For this particular issue the source mapping is <br/>
_0:23:1_

Where 0 is the byte-offset to the start of the range in the source file, 23 is the length of the source range in bytes and 1 is the index in sourceList.
