## Issues
### _Assert Violation_
A reachable exception has been detected.

It is possible to trigger an exception (opcode 0xfe). Exceptions can be caused by type errors, division by zero, out-of-bounds array access, or assert violations. Note that explicit `assert()` should only be used to check invariants. Use `require()` for regular input checking.

**Issue ID under Smart Contract Weakness Classification and Test Cases: SWC-110**

**Low Severity**

#### Locations
The compiler generates a mapping from the bytecode to the range in the source code that generated the instruction known as source mapping.

For this particular issue the source mapping is <br/>
_156:1:1_

Where 156 is the byte-offset to the start of the range in the source file, 1 is the length of the source range in bytes and 1 is the index in sourceList.
